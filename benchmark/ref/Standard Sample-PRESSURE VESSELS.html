    <p data-page="1">The term “ Category&quot; as used herein defines the location of a joint in a vessel, but not the ψpe of joint. The “Cate gories&quot; established by this paragraph are for use else where in this Division in specifying special requirements regarding joint ψpe and degree of inspec tion for certain welded pressure joints. Since these special requirements, which are based on service, material, and thickness, do not apply to every welded joint, only those joints to which special requirements apply are included in the categories. The special requirements will apply to joints of a given category only when speci짐 cally so stated. The joints included in each category are designated as joints of Categories A, B, C, and D below. Figure UW-3 il lustrates typical joint locations included in each category. Welded joints not defined by the category designations include but are not limited to Figure 5-1, illustrations (a), (c), and (d) corner joints; Figure 9-5 jacket-closure to-shell welds; and Figure 26-13 fillet welds.

    <p data-page="3">The Manufacturer is responsible for the selection of welding consumables and welding processes. These non mandatory guidelines for welding material selections are intended to achieve suitable vessel performance for the intended service conditions, but may not be appropriate for every condition in the absence of specific technical reasons to do otherwise. The user or his designated agent should inform the Manufacturer when a specific filler me tal selection is necessary to achieve satisfactory vessel performance for the intended service conditions.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(a) The tensile strength ofthe weld should equal or ex  ceed that of the base metals to be joined. When base me  tals of different strengths are to be joined by welding, the  tensile strength of the weld metal should equal or exceed  that of the weaker of the two base metals.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(b) When considerations such as  corrosion resistance,  toughness, or fatigue resistance require selecting welding  consumables or processes that produce weld joints of a  lesser strength  than  either  of the  base  metals, the  strength of the  resulting joint should be reviewed and  the design adjusted as  appropriate for  the intended ser  vice  conditions.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(c)When welding materials  of like  composition, the  nominal composition of the weld metal should be analo  gous to the nominal composition ofthe base metal, except  when creep  or corrosion performance is  an overriding  consideration.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(d) When  welding materials of different nominal  com  position, the  nominal  composition  of the weld  metal  should be analogous to  one of the base metals, or be of  an acceptable alternative composition.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(e)  When joining nonferrous base metals, filler  metal  selections should follow  the  recommendations  of the  manufacturer of the nonferrous metal  or applicable in  dustry associations.</p>

    <p data-page="3">UW-8  GENERAL</p>
    <p data-page="3">The rules in the following paragraphs apply specifically to the design of pressure vessels and vessel parts that are fabricated by welding and shall be used in conjunction with the general requirements for Design in Subsection A, and with the specific requirements for Des띤 n in Sub section C that pertain to the class of material used.</p>

    <p data-page="3">[띠 Permissible η'pes. The types of welded joints per mitted in arc and gas welding processes for Categories A, B, C, and D joints are listed in Table UW-12, together with the limiting plate thickness permitted for each ψpe. Other types of welded joints are permitted as specifically allowed in this Subsection. Butt ψpe joints only are per mitted with pressure welding processes [see UW-27(a)(2)].</p>
    <p data-page="3">(b)  Welding  Grooves.  The  dimensions  and shape  of the  edges to be joined shall be such as  to permit complete fu  sion and  complete joint penetration. Qualification of the  welding procedure, as  required  in  UW-28, is  acceptable  as  proof that the welding groove is  satisfactory.</p>
    <p data-page="3">(c)  Tapered Transitions</p>

(3  mm), whichever is  less.  The  transition  may be  formed  by any process  that  will  provide  a  uniform taper.  When  the  transition  is  formed  by removing material from the thicker section,  the minimum thickness of that section, after the material  is  removed , shall  not be  less  than  that  required  by  UG-23(c). When the transition is  formed by adding addi  tional weld  metal beyond what would otherwise be the  edge ofthe weld, such additional weld metal buildup shall  be  subject to  the requirements  of UW-42. The  butt weld  may be  partly or entirely in the tapered section or adja  cent to it. This  paragraph also applies when there is  a re  duction in thickness within a spherical shell or cylindrical  shell course and to a taper at a Category A  joint within a  formed  head.  Provisions  for tapers  at circumferential,  butt welded  joints  connecting formed  heads  to  main  shells  are contained  in UW-13.</p>

The user or his designated agent [see U-2(a)] shall establish the type of joint and the extent of examinatìon when the rules of this Division do not man date specific requirements. Rules for determìning the ap plicabìlity of the efficiencies are found in the various paragraphs covering design equations [for example, see UG-24(a) and UG-27].

(-b)  The longitudinal weld  from  the  edge  of the  plate through the  offset shall be examined by the mag  netic  particle  method  after the  offsetting  operation.  Cracks  and cracklike  defects  are unacceptable and shall  be repaired or removed.
(-c)  As  an acceptable alternative to magnetic par  ticle examination or when magnetic particle methods are  not feasible because of the nonferromagnetic character of  the weld deposit, a liquid penetrant method shall be used.
