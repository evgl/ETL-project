    <h1 data-page="2">1.  GENERAL</h1>
    <p data-page="2">This specification covers the minimum requirements for technical content of vendor data requirements.</p>
    <p data-page="2">The Vendor shall furnish all Engineering Data identified by the “Vendor Data Requirements” as required with Quotation. Failure to submit data which is required to be submitted with the proposal shall constitute an &quot;incomplete quotation&quot; and shall be cause for elimination of the Vendor from further consideration in the bid analysis process.</p>
    <p data-page="2">In the event of conflict in the purchase order documents, the Vendor shall immediately notify SKEC and request a resolution. The Vendor is not at liberty to assume which instruction shall govern.</p>
    <h1 data-page="2">2.  SCOPE</h1>
    <p data-page="2">Project specification PEMS-00035 “Vendor Documentation Requirements”, stipulates what vendor documentation shall be reviewed by SKEC during design and minimum content requirements for Manufacturers’ Record Books and Operating and Maintenance Manuals. This specification details the minimum requirements for the technical content of vendor documentation.</p>
    <p data-page="2">The quantity, mechanism for and timing of vendor document submission are detailed in the CONTRACT (see 3.1 below).</p>
