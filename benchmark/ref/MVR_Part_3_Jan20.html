Longitudinal Bulkheads</h1>
    <h2 data-page="0">1 Methods of Calculation</h2>
    <p data-page="0">The nominal total shear stress in the side shell or longitudinal bulkhead plating is related to the shear flow at that point, by the following equation:
= N/t, kN/cm2 (tf/cm2, Ltf/in2)
= shear flow,  kN/cm (tf/cm, Ltf/in.)
= thickness of the plating, cm (in.)</p>
    <h2 data-page="0">3 Calculation of the Shear Flow Around Closed Sections</h2>
    <p data-page="0">The shear flow of a closed and prismatic structure is expressed by the following equation.</p>
    <p data-page="0">=</p>
    <p data-page="0">(Fm/I)+Ni, kN/cm (tf/cm, Ltf/in.)</p>
    <p data-page="0">= total shear force at the section under consideration, in kN(tf, Ltf)</p>
    <p data-page="0">first moment about the neutral axis of the section, in cm3(in3), of the area of the longitudinal material between the zero shear level and the vertical level, at which the shear stress is being calculated</p>

    <p data-page="0">=</p>
    <p data-page="0">cm3(in3)</p>
    <p data-page="0">= moment of inertia of the section, in cm4(in4)</p>
    <p data-page="0">= constant shear flow around the cell regarded as an integration constant of unknown value arising from substituting the statically indeterminate structure by statically determinate one, in kN/cm (tf/cm, Ltf/in)</p>
    <p data-page="0">= distance from section neutral axis to a point in the girth, positive downward, in cm(in.)</p>
    <p data-page="0">equivalent sectional area of the stiffener or girder attached to the deck, shell and bulkhead plating, in cm2(in2)</p>
    <p data-page="0">=</p>
    <p data-page="0">= length along girth and longitudinal bulkhead, in cm (in.)</p>
    <h2 data-page="0">5 Calculation of</h2>
    <p data-page="0">To calculate the value of requires the knowledge or assumption of a zero shear point in the closed cell. As an example, in the case of a simplified tanker section, the deck point at the centerline is a known point of zero shear in the absence of the centerline girder. An arbitrary point may be chosen in the wing tank cell. Superposition of the constant to the shear flow resulting from the assumption of zero shear point will yield to the correct shear flow around the wing cell.</p>
    <h2 data-page="0">7 Determination of</h2>
    <p data-page="0">is determined by using Bredt's torsion formula, making use of the assumption that there is no twist in the cell section, i.e., the twist moment resulting from the shear flow around a closed cell should equal zero,</p>
    <h3 data-page="1">or  . In a multicell structure of   number of cells, the formula can be written for the ith cell   as
follows.</h3>
    <p data-page="1">Div = common division between cell and the adjacent cells and .</p>
    <p data-page="1">The first term represents twist moment around cell at the assumed statically determined status. The values are calculated upon arbitrary zero shear points in the cell and the adjacent cells. The remaining terms in the equations represent the balancing twist moments around cell and of those carried out by the common divisions in the adjacent cells and .</p>

    <h4 data-page="2">3.1.1 Loading Manual</h4>
    <p data-page="2">A loading manual is a document containing sufficient information to assist the master of the vessel to arrange for the loading and ballasting of the vessel in such a way as to avoid the creation of any unacceptable stresses in the vessel’s structure.</p>
    <h4 data-page="2">3.1.2 Loading Instrument</h4>
    <p data-page="2">A loading instrument is an instrument designed to assess vessel’s still water bending moments, shear forces and, where applicable, the still water torsional moments and lateral loads at the specified points along the length for the purpose not to exceed the specified values in any loaded or ballast condition.</p>
    <h3 data-page="2">3.3 Category I Vessels</h3>
    <p data-page="2">Category I vessels are any of the following:
i) Vessels   with   large   deck   openings   where   combined   stresses   due   to   vertical   and   horizontal   hull girder bending, torsional and lateral loads need be considered, such as container carriers.
ii) Vessels designed for non-homogeneous loading where the cargo and/or ballast may be unevenly distributed,  except  those  belonging  to  3-2-A2/3.5.iii.  Examples  of  such  vessel  are  bulk  carriers, ore carriers and combination carriers.
iii) Vessels, such as oil carriers and fuel carriers, except those belonging to 3-2-A2/3.5.iii.

ii) Vessels on regular and fixed trading pattern where the loading manual gives sufficient guidance, such as ro-ro ferries.
iii) Vessels   less   than   120   m   (394   ft)   in   length,   L,   when   their   design   takes   into   account   the   uneven distribution of cargo or ballast.</p>
    <h2 data-page="3">5 Loading Documents</h2>
    <h3 data-page="3">5.1 Loading Manual</h3>
    <p data-page="3">All vessels are to be provided with a loading manual reviewed and stamped by ABS in accordance with 3-2-A2/7, except for Category II vessels with deadweight not exceeding 30% of the displacement at the summer load line.</p>
    <h3 data-page="3">5.3 Modifications</h3>
    <p data-page="3">Where modifications to the vessel or to the loading/trading pattern result in changes to the input information, a revised or new loading manual is to be submitted and a stamped copy is to be placed aboard the vessel to replace the existing manual. The loading instrument is to be verified in accordance with 3-2- A2/9.3 or newly installed and verified in such cases.</p>
    <p data-page="3">Where changes due to modification of the vessel are such that the still water bending moments and shear forces corresponding to the new loading conditions are within ±2% of the existing allowable values, the existing allowable values need not be modified.</p>
    <h2 data-page="3">7 Loading Manual</h2>

ii) The results of the calculations of still water bending moments and shear forces.
iii) Permissible   limits   of   still   water   bending   moments   and   shear   forces   and,   where   applicable, limitations due to torsional and lateral loads.
iv) Maximum allowable local lower decks and double bottom loading.
v) If cargoes other than bulk cargoes are contemplated, such as different deck cargoes, they are to be listed together with any specific instructions for loading.
vi) Maximum allowable load on deck and hatch covers. If the vessel is not approved to carry load on deck or hatch covers, that fact is to be clearly stated in the loading manual.
